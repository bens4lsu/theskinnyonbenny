<h1>Why is there advertising on theskinnyonbenny?</h1>

<p>Creating content for you guys is fun, but it isn't free.  As a matter of fact, it's kind of expensive.  I know that it's hard to look at this site and think that any money at all could have been put into it, but that is indeed the case.</p>

<p>If you see something interesting over to the side, click the link, and check it out.  It will help keep this site up and running, and it will fund new toys, which will lead to more features and things on this site.</p>

<p>Besides, the software that generates these advertisements is sometimes unintentionally funny.  It scans the page and tries to display advertising that is relevant.  For example, on the page where I have a limerick about a dog getting neutered, it latched onto the "crotch red and sore" line, and offered me advertising for products for vaginal problems.  Let me know when you find good ones.
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>
