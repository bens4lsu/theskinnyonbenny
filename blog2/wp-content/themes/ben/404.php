		You have selected a post that has been marked as "Private."  It is most likely that it was once a public post, but someone got scared that either ben or Mrs. theskinnyonbenny would get fired or lose all contact with a loved one.  Perhaps it will one day be re-posted.<br /><br />Although this must certainly seem annoying, it's the only way that I have to capture what are otherwise really funny stories for posterity.  Otherwise, they would be lost forever.
