<h2>Cleaning off my DVR</h2>
<small>December 20, 2005</small>

<p>First, I should mention that this page is going to take a little while to load.  It's probably stupid for me to try to load two videos and two audio files in one page.  Let me know if it causes you grief, and I'll design it better instead of easier.</p><p>This is a collection of recordings that I saved over the course of the year, just to post here.  I started the project this summer, and have just gotten around to creating the page.</p>

This is an interview with a survivor who rode out the storm in Pearlington, MS, which is pretty much where the eye passed.<br><br>The "guy by name of Boogie" goes on in the story to teach some church volunteers from Wisconsin all about his automatic firearm collection.</td><td><EMBED  NAME="nsplay" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/download/default.asp" SRC="/sound/GuyByNameOfBoogie.mpa" TYPE="application/x-mplayer2"  AUTOSTART="0" SHOWCONTROLS="1"  align="right"><noembed>Sorry Captain.

<tr><td class="caption">Since itunes integrated podcasts, I've been sampling them like crazy.  Most are really, really bad.  There's one that I'm sticking with that you might find surprising.  It's a column from The Village Voice by Michael Musto, and it's just a free for all take on homosexual life in Manhattan.<br><br>I'm not sure that it would be interesting at all as a written column, but read aloud, it is hillarious.  Here's a sample of why I think so.</td><td><EMBED  NAME="nsplay" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/download/default.asp" SRC="/sound/Musto.mpa" TYPE="application/x-mplayer2"  AUTOSTART="0" SHOWCONTROLS="1"  align="right"><noembed>Sorry Captain.
