			There are many interesting restaurants and food stores that I have seen recently that demonstrate the diversity of my new community. I took a picture of a few of them to share. It is not so much the existence of these stores and restaurants that amaze me, it is the quantity. I literally could have taken 100 pictures of similar restaurants and food stores. <br /><br />

			My favorites are the Cluck U Chicken Express and the Roti Shop. The chicken shop is right at the gates of Seton Hall’s main campus. I bet that really annoys the priests and nuns which run the school. I can’t remember where the Roti Shop is but the fact that they serve goat was very amusing to me. . I thought it was funny that the Family Buffet Restaurant served American, Italian and Chinese food. Truly a restaurant serving the diverse family.
