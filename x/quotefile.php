			A guy that I used to work for kept a file of quotes that struck him as funny.  His file
			grew for years and years.  When he left the company, I realized that the only way to save
			those types of things for myself was to start keeping a similar file for myself.<BR><BR>  For
			some reason, my quotes have a tendency to be nastier.  I guess that's because very few of these
			actually came from work, because I have nasty friends, and because I still think that bad
			words are funny, even though I should be old enough to be over that.<BR><BR>
