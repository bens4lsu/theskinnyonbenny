		<p>Dog, have you gone and lost your mind?  Since when do dogs and dirt not go hand-in-hand.  You may quote Thoreau all you like.  You may have even read a little of his work.  If so, you know that he wrote a really long, boring, work near a pond.  You really seem inspired by the boring part in there.  There may be some gems that I missed though.  I only skimmed as soon as you started that highfalutin quoting.  Click that menu over to your left and find the quote file.  Now <i>those</i> are quotes worth repeating.</p>

		<p>First of all, let me point out that there are at least hundreds of millions of internet sites out there.  There are probably hundreds of thousands that let you start a message board or your own blog with very little or no technical know-how.  Yet you choose my own site as your desired posting spot.  Oh well, at least anyone who finds this page already likes me.</p>

		<p>Now allow me to return to the topic of ponds.  Remember when we walked up to the pretty little pond on the cool gray winter afternoon?  And remember how you flopped on your back to squirm around in goose poop before I could even unhook you?  Who scrubbed you down with Head and Shoulders, in the absence of dog shampoo?</p>

		<p>How about when we go to the farm and you run and play and play, then ride home in Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's nice new car, with god knows what kind of poop caked between your neck and your collar?  Who keeps his lip buttoned until after we're home?</p>

		<p>And, oh yeah, which of us humps any guest we have -- man, woman, boy, or girl -- assuming they make the  mistake of sitting calmly on the floor when you're in the mood to play?</p>

		<p>One more thing:  have you seen this photo of yourself on the limerick page?</p><p><img src="/img/daisy-toilet.JPG"></p>

<p>I think we've said enough about honor.</p>
