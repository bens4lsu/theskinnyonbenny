	<div class="caption">Submitted by Sarah Schultz, Special to theskinnyonbenny.com<br/><br/>Why send your resignation letter to theskinnyonbenny instead of to your boss?  Well, it takes less balls for one thing.  For another, you might actually have rent to pay.  This was good enough to post.  Feel free to send your own resignation letters to me, and if they amuse me, you might find it listed here.<p >&nbsp;</p></div>
		<p >February 25, 2005</p>

		<p >Dear Bruce,</p>

		<p >&nbsp;</p>

		<p >Please allow this letter to serve as two weeks notice of my
		resignation with Choosing the Best.  I anticipate my last day of work to be on March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2005.  </p>

		<p >I cannot stand to come to this place anymore.  I am sick and
		tired of having to pretend on a daily basis that I am someone I am not.  I do
		not give an iota about your little pretend-Christian company.  I do not care
		about your personal life, that you are friends with the governor, that you
		hobnob with George Bush, etc.  I do not care that your wife used to have
		anorexia, that she uses a special night cream to avoid skin cancer, or that she
		has yeast "from her mouth to her anus".  I hate knowing this kind of thing
		about both of you.  It is inappropriate, and, quite frankly, disgusting.</p>



		<p >I am sick and tired of being required to be your bitch.
		Never again will I do demeaning tasks to kiss either one of your asses again.
		I will never be requested to dig out your filling from a tootsie roll, to go to
		your house to get your mail while you are out of town, to mail invitations to a
		personal party to which I am not even invited, to order shit for Donna, to call
		for a parking spot for you downtown, or even to do the damn dishes.  I am NOT
		the Cook Family Bitch, and you are finally going to have to realize that.  I
		sincerely look forward to the day you are busy yet have to go and get your own
		Chick-Fil-A Number 7 Combo with Diet Lemonade, or, better yet, attempt to get Carol Walker to go and pick it up for you.  Good luck with that, I believe she will politely
		tell you to kiss her ass.</p>



		<p >I really do hope that Choosing the Best continues to
		prosper, only so that people like Cliff, Carol, John, and Ahmun can continue to
		support themselves.  Your sorry rich asses don’t need it, but you are too
		miserly to ever realize that, so at least the rest should continue to benefit.
		That is, if your pride doesn’t do you in by continuing to annihilate all of the
		  Georgia business which comprises some 70% of your income, and some 80% of
		Cliff’s income, which you are flushing down the toilet.  Shame on you, Bruce Cook, you pseudo-Christian.</p>



		<p >Let me go ahead and warn you:  God has made it clear to me
		that He does not like it when people use Him to benefit themselves.  He gets a
		little snippy and He will SMITE you if you are not careful.  Watch yourself.
		You are not an angel.  You be careful.  "They will know we are Christians by
		our Love" does not exactly describe you OR Donna.</p>



		<p >I know fully well that you are going to talk smack about me
		the second the door closes on my back.  That’s the only way that you can make
		this be my fault and not yours.  Go right ahead.  I would be disappointed if
		you didn’t; it would prove you to be better people than I believe you to be.  I
		want you to go ahead and say that Sarah was bad news from the "get-go"...  say
		that I never did anything right...  say that I made constant mistakes and
		couldn’t be counted on...  say that I wasn’t good at anything...  say that I
		wouldn’t have made it long anyway...</p>



		<p >Then, let’s look at my history:  I was a top sales person
		from the setup.  I brought in large customers from SCRATCH- the first to do
		that since Leslie (who was another person you shouldn’t have taken for granted,
		but that is another story).  I was the only person who ever did your travel the
		way you liked it (but even that you found reason to be disenchanted with,
		because you are Bruce Cook, the forever displeased).  I was the one who could
		be trusted to find the most cost-effective ways to place orders, so John let me
		do it with VERY little supervision...  I was the one who knew the policies so
		well, I wrote the policy manual...  I was the one who came in and answered the
		phones so well that customers ALWAYS commented on "Sarah with the sweet
		voice".  I was the first receptionist who could EVER offer customer service.  I
		was a receptionist who helped train your sales staff.</p>



		<p >Enjoy your time without me.  I know I will.</p>



		<p >Good luck replacing me.  I hope you find a perfect new
		Sarah.  I am sure you will be delighted with whatever you find, and I am sure
		that the new person will last two years, just like I did.  Especially being
		paid $32,000 to be a sales person, a personal assistant, an executive
		assistant, a sales assistant, an office manager, a receptionist, a travel
		coordinator, an office mommy/wife, a marketing assistant, a P/R assistant, and
		a dishwasher all at once.  With a bachelor’s degree at that.</p>



		<p >Much love,</p>
