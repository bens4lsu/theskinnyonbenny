            From the Oprah Winfrey show, April 22, 2004.&nbsp; We know that Ms.
            Winfrey and her producers would smile on this unauthorized&nbsp; recreation
            of their broadcast.
            <p>Give this plenty of time to load.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would expect it to
            take more than two minutes if you have a high speed
            connection.&nbsp; If you are on dialup, this video isn't worth the
            hour wait.</p>
            <p>One more thing:&nbsp; whoever pauses Oprah with the funniest
            facial expression, captures the screen shot, and <a href="mailto:bens@theskinnyonbenny.com" class="caption">emails
            it to me</a> wins a prize.</p>
