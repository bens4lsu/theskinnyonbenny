		<h2>Bert on Oprah and Lookin' Good</h2>

        <p>Crystal
          goes to see a filming of the Oprah show.&nbsp; I don't know if she was
          invited, or just went on her own volition, but it really doesn't
          matter.&nbsp; She gets an episode where Oprah's producers come out and
          talk about some of their favorite segments from years past.&nbsp; The
          segment that interests us is something about a dying mother who makes
          videos and writes notes for her daughter to watch as she grows up.</p><p>Here
          is the end of the segment.&nbsp; It's one of the funniest things that
          I've ever seen on TV.&nbsp; If you have trouble making the video work
          from this web site, keep trying, and call your company's support desk
          for help if necessary.&nbsp; It's that important.

          <p>If you are interested in more -- and honestly, how
          could you be otherwise -- here are some links to supplemental
          material..</p><p><a href="mailto:clambert@hntb.com" class="mainbox">Email
          Crystal</a>, and let her know what you think.&nbsp; It would be
          especially good to email her if you don't know her.</p><p><a onclick="window.open('Crystal_WholeSeg.html','Oprah','width=700,height=400,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=no');" href="./Crystal.html" class="mainbox">
          See the
          whole segment.</a> This is good for you middle-aged women who just
          need a good, old-fashioned cry and have a while to wait for a big
          video to download.&nbsp; By the way, I am totally without
          permission to show this copyrighted content.&nbsp; Call me a
          pirate.&nbsp; And don't even think about it without a high speed
          connection.</p><p>And most amazingly, I've developed some
          technology that actually lets me capture what the mind is thinking of
          people appearing on television.&nbsp; So for the first time anywhere,
          theskinnyonbenny.com presents <a onclick="window.open('Crystal_MindRead.html','Oprah','width=700,height=400,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=no');" href="./Crystal.html" class="mainbox"> the thought reading version of that same
          clip.</a></p>
          <p>Hope you enjoyed this segment, and for those of you
          who know me, I hope you don't find yourself on my Tivo any time soon.</p>
