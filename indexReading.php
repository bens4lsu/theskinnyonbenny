<p>Every now and then, I try to read something a little more difficult.  I'm struggling with this one through the first slow-moving quarter of the book.</p>

<p>Through 90% of the book, it's just like the movie.  The writing is good, and I like the book's different ending better.</p>

<p>This is a re-read.  I have recalled it as a favorite from probably close to twenty years ago, and it's as good as I had hoped it would be.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to read this for a long time, to see if it lived up to the hype.  It didn't -- but how could it have?  It's not bad, but certainly not that great.</p>

<p>A big thumbs-up for this collection of essays.</p>

<p>This is the Cinderella story, as told by an ugly stepsister.  It's worth the easy read, just for the creativity.</p>

<p>I just finished this one.  I know it's popular, but I didn't think it was all that good.  The mystery isn't much of a mystery, and the text is written as if it were being penned by an autistic kid, which gets annoying.</p>

<p>I thought this one was really, really good.</p>

<p>This is a dull history of the New Orleans underworld.  There are a couple of good snippits, but it's really way too boring for me to recommend it to others.</p>

<p>An intriguing mystery story.  I'm enjoying this quite a bit.</p>

<p>Top notch, hilarious, easy read.  Classic Bryson.</p>

<p>This was decent.  Not fantastic, but okay.</p>
